Well , my opinion at the begining was an astronaut drinking coffee in a jungle. So i searched this title "an astronaut drinking coffee in a forest" and here is the result:

then i thought this forest is somehow fantasy so i changed the word "forest" to spaceship and i added croissant to make it more delicious! here is the title and the result as you can see "an astronaut drinking coffee and croissant in a spaceship"

i didn't really want this result , i wanted it more like a dream so i changed the spaceship to a dark cloudy lanscape:"an astronaut drinking coffee and croissant in a cloudy and dark lanscape"
