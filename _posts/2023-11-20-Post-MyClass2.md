<h5 style="text-align:center; color:'brown'">A fractal tree is a tree made up by creating recursive branching in a graphics module in python.
i used turtle module.
first of all ,i imported turtle module .
Then i needed branches which the basic idea of it is to go forward , then a little bit left ,then back to the origin and move right to make a ("Y") shape .
after all , repeating it on a loop with reducing distance and here we go !!!</h5>
